# Charity: Water Game:  Unnamed
Tech stack: JS, HTML, and CSS with use of Copilot

Exchanged assets to be made fully by me and made gameplay better. 

Primary fixes:

- Collisions are off by one block and player can pass through the edge blocks.
- Current gameplay has no obstacles and no negative conseequences to engage players.
  - Add fall damamge that will make the player drop all of the collected bottles except for the original one.
  - make it so that if a player jumps or presses the down button ontop of a cliff, they are jumped down onto a lower level. This shouldn't work for the ground.
  - make it so that a player can jump up onto a ledge at its start, but can't jump on if theyve fallen off in the middle
  - add a progress bar
  -
